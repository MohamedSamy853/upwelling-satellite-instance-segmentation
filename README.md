## Instance Segmentation for Upwelling Satellite Image Analysis
This repository provides an implementation of instance segmentation using a U-Net architecture with ResNet as the backbone for feature extraction. The purpose of this project is to detect the presence of specific phonemes in upwelling satellite images.
## Introduction
Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves identifying and delineating individual objects within an image. In this project, we focus on using instance segmentation to detect the presence of specific phonemes in upwelling satellite images. Upwelling satellite images capture oceanic conditions and can provide valuable information for various applications, including marine research, climate studies, and resource management.

The U-Net architecture is a popular choice for instance segmentation tasks due to its effectiveness in capturing both local and global features. By using ResNet as the backbone for feature extraction, we can leverage the pre-trained weights and benefit from its powerful feature representation capabilities
